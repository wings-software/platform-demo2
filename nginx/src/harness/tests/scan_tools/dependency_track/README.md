-Dependency Track-

Dependency Track is an intelligent Software Supply Chain Component Analysis platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk from the use of third-party and open source components. Dependency Track takes a unique and highly beneficial approach by leveraging the capabilities of Software Bill-of-Materials (SBoM) which provides capabilities that traditional Software Composition Analysis (SCA) solutions cannot achieve.
